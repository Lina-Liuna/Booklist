CompTIA Network

=== What Does This Book Cover?
Chapter 1, “Introduction to Networks” This chapter includes an introduction to what a
network is and an overview of the most common physical network topologies you'll find in
today’s networks.

Chapter 2, “The Open Systems Interconnection Specifications” This chapter covers the
OSI model, what it is, what happens at each of its layers, and how each layer works.

Chapter 3, “Networking Topologies, Connectors, and Wiring Standards” This chapter
covers the various networking media and topologies, plus the cable types and properties
used in today’s networks.

Chapter 4, “The Current Ethernet Specifications” This chapter covers how a basic
Ethernet LAN works and describes and categorizes the different Ethernet specifications.

Chapter 5, “Networking Devices” It’s important for you to understand all the various
devices used in today’s networks, and this chapter will describe how hubs, routers, and
switches and some other devices work within a network.

Chapter 6, “Introduction to the Internet Protocol” This is your introduction to the all-
important IP protocol stack.

Chapter 7, “IP Addressing” This chapter will take up from where Chapter 6 left off and
move into IP addressing. It also contains information about public versus private addressing
and DHCP.

Chapter 8, “IP Subnetting, Troubleshooting IP, and Introduction to NAT” Beginning
where Chapter 7 ends, we'll be tackling IP subnetting in this one. But no worries here—I’ve
worked hard to make this not-so-popular-yet-vital topic as painless as possible.

Chapter 9, “Introduction to IP Routing” This is an introduction to routing that basically cov-
ers what routers do and how they do it. This chapter, along with Chapter 10 and Chapter 11,
cover routing and switching in much more detail than what is necessary to meet the CompTIA
Network+ objectives because this knowledge is so critical to grasp when working with today’s
networks.

Chapter 10, “Routing Protocols” This chapter goes into detail describing the protocols
that run on routers and that update routing tables to create a working map of the network.

Chapter 11, “Switching and Virtual LANs” This chapter covers Layer 2 switching, the
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and virtual LANs. I went deeper than needed for the exam
with the routing chapters, and I’ll cover switching and virtual LANs (which are also vital
in today’s corporate networks) more thoroughly as well.

Chapter 12, “Wireless Networking” Because wireless is so important for both home and
business networks today, this chapter is loaded with all the information you need to be
successful at wireless networking at home and work.

Chapter 13, “Authentication and Access Control” This is the first of three security chapters.
There are tons of exam objectives about network security that are so important that I took
three chapters to cover all of them. In this chapter, I’ll introduce security, security filtering,
tunneling, and user authentication.

Chapter 14, “Network Threats and Mitigation” This is probably the most fun of the
three security chapters because I'll tell you all about security threats and how to stop them.
The only way to get good at network security is to implement it, and this chapter shows
you how.

Chapter 15, “Physical and Hardware Security” This chapter’s focus is on explaining basic
firewalls, security devices, and device security.

Chapter 16, “Wide Area Networks” In this chapter, you get to learn all about things like
Frame Relay, E1/T1, DSL, cable modems, and more. All of the CompTIA Network+ WAN
objectives are covered in this chapter.

Chapter 17, “Troubleshooting Tools” This is also a fun chapter because again, you can
follow along and run all the commands yourself. And I repeat, it’s a really good idea to run
through all the commands in this chapter!

Chapter 18, “Software and Hardware Tools” This chapter introduces you to the network
tools you will use to help you run your networks. Both software and hardware tools will
be discussed.

Chapter 19, “Network Troubleshooting” In almost every chapter, I discuss how to verify
and fix problems, but this chapter will really get into the nuts and bolts of detailed network
troubleshooting and documentation.

Chapter 20, “Management, Monitoring, and Optimization” This last chapter will pro-
vide configuration-management documentation and covers wiring, logical diagrams, base-
lines, policies, and regulations.

=== Introduction
==== 1.0 Network Concepts 21%
===== 1.1 Compare the layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models.
OSI model:
» Layer 1 - Physical
Layer 2 - Data link
» Layer 3 - Network
Layer 4 - Transport
= Layer 5S - Session
Layer 6 — Presentation
«Layer 7 - Application

TCP/IP model:
= Network Interface Layer
= Internet Layer
Transport Layer
» Application Layer

===== 1.2 Classify how applications, devices, and protocols relate to the OSI model layers.

===== 1. Physical Layer (Layer 1):
Devices: Hubs, Repeaters, Cables, Network Adapters

Protocols: Ethernet, USB, HDMI

===== 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
The Data Link Layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of frames between nodes on the same network link.

Frames are the units of data at this layer and consist of both data and control information.

The Data Link Layer adds a header and trailer to the data received from the Network Layer (Layer 3), creating a frame for transmission over the physical medium.

Devices: Switches, Bridges, NICs (Network Interface Cards)

Protocols: MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

===== 3. Network Layer (Layer 3):
The Network Layer is responsible for logical addressing, routing, and forwarding of data between different networks.

It deals with packets, which are units of data that include both the actual data being transmitted and the network-layer header information, such as source and destination IP addresses.

Devices: Routers, Layer 3 Switches

Protocols: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

===== 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4):
Devices: Gateways

Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

===== 5. Session Layer (Layer 5):
Software: NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)

===== 6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
Software: Encryption/Decryption software, Compression software

Protocols: SSL/TLS

===== 7. Application Layer (Layer 7):
Software: Web browsers, Email clients, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients

Protocols: HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP

==== 1.3 Explain the purpose and properties of IP addressing.

===== 1. Purpose of IP Addressing:
*Host Identification*:=
The primary purpose of IP addressing is to uniquely identify and locate devices (hosts) on a network. Every device connected to a network must have a unique IP address to enable communication.

*Routing*:
IP addresses are used for routing data across networks. Routers use the destination IP address in the packets to determine the next hop on the network path towards the intended destination.

*Logical Addressing*:
IP addresses provide a logical addressing scheme that abstracts the underlying physical network. This allows for flexibility and scalability as devices can be added or removed without changing the entire physical infrastructure.

*Communication*:
IP addressing enables communication between devices within the same network or across different networks. Devices use IP addresses to send and receive data packets, allowing for end-to-end communication.

*Internet Connectivity*:
IP addresses are essential for devices to connect to the global Internet. Public IP addresses are assigned to devices connected directly to the Internet, allowing them to communicate with other devices worldwide.

===== 2. Properties of IP Addressing:

*Uniqueness*:

*Hierarchical Structure*:

IP addresses are structured hierarchically, with different classes and subnets. This hierarchy allows for efficient and organized addressing, making it easier to manage large networks.

*Versioning*:
IP addresses exist in two main versions: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit). IPv4 is the most widely used, but due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 is introduced to provide a larger address space.

*Dynamic and Static Assignment*:
IP addresses can be assigned dynamically through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or statically configured. Dynamic assignment is common for end-user devices, while servers and network infrastructure may use static assignments.

*Public and Private Addressing*:
IP addresses are categorized as public or private. Public addresses are routable on the global Internet, while private addresses are used within private networks and are not routable on the Internet.

*Subnetting*:
Subnetting allows the division of an IP network into smaller, manageable sub-networks. It aids in efficient address utilization and network organization.

==== 1.4 Explain the purpose and properties of routing and switching.
Routing and switching are fundamental building blocks of any network, but they tackle different tasks on different levels:

===== 1. Switching:
*Purpose*:
Connects devices within a single network segment (like a local area network, LAN) by forwarding data packets based on their MAC addresses. Think of it like a smart mail sorter that reads the recipient's name (MAC address) and sends it to the appropriate delivery point (network port).

*Properties*:
Layer 2 device: Operates at the data link layer of the OSI model.
High speed: Switches forward data very quickly, often at gigabit or even terabit speeds.
Limited scope: Only works within a single network segment.
Broadcast domain: All devices connected to a switch receive all broadcast packets, regardless of the intended recipient.

===== 2. Routing:

*Purpose*:
Connects multiple networks together by forwarding data packets based on their IP addresses. Imagine it as a traffic controller directing vehicles based on their final destinations and choosing the optimal route through a network of roads.

*Properties*:
Layer 3 device: Operates at the network layer of the OSI model.
Intelligent path selection: Uses routing protocols to determine the best path for a packet to reach its destination across multiple networks.
Larger scope: Connects different networks, enabling communication across organizations or geographical locations.
Segmentation: Routers divide networks into smaller segments, reducing broadcast traffic and improving security.

Here's a simple analogy:
Think of your home network as a building.
Switches connect devices within each room (segments), while the router acts as the front door, connecting your building (network) to the outside world (other networks).

*To summarize*:

Switching: For fast, efficient communication within a single network segment.
Routing: For connecting and navigating between different networks.
They both play crucial roles in building and managing efficient and secure networks, keeping the data flowing smoothly between devices.

==== 1.6 Explain the function of common networking protocols. .
 **Here's an explanation of the functions of common networking protocols:**

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):**

* Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.
* Uses a handshake process to establish connections and sequence numbers to ensure data arrives in the correct order.
* Employs acknowledgements (ACKs) and retransmissions to handle lost or corrupted packets.
* Commonly used for web browsing, file transfers, email, and other applications that require reliable data delivery.

**File Transfer Protocol (FTP):**

* Specifically designed for transferring files between computers over a network.
* Uses TCP for reliable data transfer.
* Supports features like authentication, file listing, directory navigation, and file transfer modes (ASCII or binary).

**User Datagram Protocol (UDP):**

* Offers a connectionless, unreliable transport service.
* Doesn't guarantee delivery or order of packets.
* Used for applications that prioritize speed over reliability, such as video streaming, online gaming, and voice over IP (VoIP).

**TCP/IP Suite:**

* A collection of protocols that form the foundation of the internet.
* Named after its two core protocols, TCP and IP (Internet Protocol).
* Includes other essential protocols like UDP, ICMP, DNS, DHCP, and more.

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):**

* Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
* Simplifies network administration and configuration.
* Commonly used in home and business networks.

**Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP):**

* A simpler version of FTP for basic file transfers.
* Often used for transferring small files or firmware updates.

**Domain Name System (DNS):**

* Translates human-readable domain names (like [www.google.com](https://www.google.com)) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.4.206).
* Essential for accessing websites and other internet resources.

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):**

* Secure version of HTTP, the protocol for web browsing.
* Uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt communication and protect data privacy.

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):**

* Foundation for data communication on the web.
* Defines how web browsers and servers interact to exchange information.

**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):**

* Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses (physical hardware addresses) on a local network.
* Essential for communication between devices on the same network segment.

**Session Initiation Protocol (SIP):**

* Signaling protocol for initiating and managing VoIP calls.
* Handles tasks like call setup, termination, and features like call forwarding and voicemail.

**Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP):**

* Carries the actual audio or video data in VoIP calls.
* Designed for real-time transmission with low latency.

**Secure Shell (SSH):**

* Secure protocol for remote access and administration of computers.
* Encrypts all communication to protect sensitive data.

**Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3):**

* Older protocol for retrieving email from a server.
* Typically downloads emails to a local device for offline access.

**Network Time Protocol (NTP):**

* Synchronizes clocks between devices on a network.
* Ensures accurate timekeeping for various applications and services.

**Internet Message Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4):**

* Modern protocol for accessing email on a server.
* Allows users to view and manage emails on the server without downloading them.

**Telnet:**

* Unsecure protocol for remote access and text-based communication with computers.

* Used for efficient delivery of multicast traffic, such as video streaming.

**Transport Layer Security (TLS):**

* Encryption protocol that provides secure communication over the internet.
* Used in HTTPS, email, and other applications to protect sensitive data.


==== 1.7 summary of DNS concepts and components:**

**Domain Name System (DNS):**

- **Purpose:** Translates human-readable domain names (like [www.google.com](https://www.google.com)) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.4.206), enabling internet communication.
- **Essential for:** Accessing websites, sending emails, and using other internet services that rely on domain names.

**Key Components:**

1. **Domain Names:**
   - Unique identifiers for websites and other internet resources.
   - Consist of multiple parts (e.g., www, google, com), forming a hierarchical structure.
2. **DNS Servers:**
   - Store and distribute information about domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.
   - Types include:
     - **Root servers:** The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.
     - **TLD servers:** Manage domain names within specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .net, .org).
     - **Authoritative servers:** Hold definitive information for specific domains.
     - **Recursive servers:** Act as intermediaries, querying other servers on behalf of clients.
3. **DNS Zones:**
   - Administrative sections of the DNS namespace.
   - Each zone contains records for a specific domain or subdomain.
4. **DNS Records:**
   - Individual pieces of information within a DNS zone.
   - Common types include:
     - **A records:** Map domain names to IPv4 addresses.
     - **AAAA records:** Map domain names to IPv6 addresses.
     - **CNAME records:** Create aliases for domain names.
     - **MX records:** Specify email servers for a domain.

**DNS Lookup Process (Simplified):**

1. User enters a domain name in a web browser or application.
2. Device's DNS resolver contacts a recursive server to initiate the lookup.
3. Recursive server queries various DNS servers in the hierarchy.
4. Authoritative server provides the final IP address answer.
5. Recursive server returns the IP address to the device.
6. Device can now connect to the desired website or resource using the IP address.

*Dynamic DNS*

Dynamic DNS, or DDNS, is a service that automatically updates the Domain Name System (DNS) records associated with your dynamic IP address.
This is particularly useful for home users and businesses that have internet connections with dynamic IP addresses, which means the IP address assigned to your device can change periodically.

*How DDNS works*:

You sign up for a DDNS service and create an account.
You install the DDNS client software on your computer or router.
The DDNS client software periodically checks your IP address and compares it to the one stored in your DDNS account.
If your IP address has changed, the DDNS client software automatically updates your DNS records with the new IP address.
This ensures that your domain name always points to the correct IP address, no matter how many times it changes.
