Julie Andrews was born on October 1, 1935, in a village called - Walton-on-Thames , — in England.

She grew up ina talented family. When she
_ was a little girl, her aunt would help put on show:

at a nearby playhouse. Julie’s mother would play —

piano, and her father built sets.

Julie gave her very first performance at one
of these shows. And she helped a fellow dancer
whose hat had fallen over her eyes. Even at age _
three, Julie knew the show must go on! F


When Julie was four years old, World War ge

began. At that point, Julie was living with her

mother and stepfather in London, where bombs
often fell.

To stay safe, Julie and her brother sometimes
had to go to the countryside and live with
strangers. While there, they loved learning
to ride horses.

Other times, her family hid in the London
Underground train stations with their neighbors.
Her stepfather would play guitar to take people’s

_ minds off the danger.


Meanwhile, Julie was learning to dance and sing.
She went to a special school, where she learned
ballet and tap dance. At age nine, she started taking
singing lessons.

Julie’s mother was a wonderful piano player, and her stepfather was a well-known
singer. They started to invite Julie onstage to sing with them.Julie enjoyed the
spotlight.

Not long after the war finally ended, Julie was
asked to perform for some British soldiers. She
didn’t know that Queen Elizabeth would also be

in the audience! The queen told Julie that she sang
beautifully.


Julie became known for her sweet, high
voice. She spent her teenage years traveling
around England, singing and dancing in
shows. She loved the stage, but she missed
her family when she was away.

Whenever she was homesick, Julie would
go to her dressing room and read. Books
helped her feel less lonely.



When Julie was sixteen years old, she went to
see a musical on the West End of London, where
some of the best plays in the world are performed.

Julie was amazed. The music! The costumes!
The sets! She never thought she would have the
chance to be in a show like that.

But she would—and soon! Just two years
later, Julie was cast as the star in Cinderella on
the West End. There were fancy costumes, a big
moving set, and real ponies on the stage. Julie
and the show got great reviews.

Thanks to the success of Cinderella,
Julie got her next big break—a role in a
Broadway musical, called The Boy Friend. ~~
Julie was going to New York!




Julie was sad to leave, but she couldn’t say no
to Broadway. Her whole family gathered at the
airport to see her off.

While rehearsing in New York, Julie struggled
at first. Sometimes she felt she was doing a good
job, and other times she didn’t. The director told
her to play the role as honestly as she could. On
opening night, the audience gave the show a
standing ovation.


The cast and crew waited overnight at a
nearby restaurant to read the reviews in the
next morning’s newspaper. The critics loved
the show—and Julie. It was official. Julie
Andrews was a Broadway star!


Later that year, a songwriting
duo named Lerner and Loewe were
finishing their newest musical. They

didn’t think Julie would be available
to star in it because most Broadway §

actors had two-year contracts. But
Julie had only wanted a one-year |
contract for her first show so that 7
she could visit her family sooner.

After a quick trip to England, Julie went back
to New York to star in My Fair Lady.

Julie played a flower seller named Eliza
Doolittle who learns to speak like a fancy lady.
Just like Eliza, Julie had to learn to speak in a new
accent. It was very difficult.

Her hard work paid off. My Fair Lady became
the longest-running Broadway musical at the

time, and the cast recording was the number-one
album of 1956.


Julie continued to act and sing in hit
musicals. One day, Walt Disney visited her
backstage after a show. He wanted her to star
in his next movie. Julie had performed on
Broadway, at the famous Carnegie Hall,
and on television—but never in movies.

By then, Julie had gotten married. Not long after
giving birth to her first daughter, Julie and her family
flew to Hollywood, California, so Julie could star in
Walt Disney’s Mary Poppins. Julie won the Academy
Award for Best Actress for her performance as the
magical nanny—and fans everywhere learned the
word “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.”



In 1965, just one year after Mary Poppins was
released, Julie starred in The Sound of Music. In this
movie musical, Julie played a nun in training named
Maria who falls in love while looking after seven
children in the Austrian mountains. It became one
of her most famous roles, thanks to such songs as
“My Favorite Things” and “Do-Re-Mi.”

Julie spent the next twenty years starring in
movies. She also welcomed four more children
into her life.

One day, Julie’s stepdaughter, Jenny, asked her
to write a story for her. That was when Julie came
up with the idea for her first children’s book. She
would go on to write and publish many more.


Thirty-five years after leaving New York to
make Mary Poppins, Julie finally decided to return
to Broadway. She brought her role from the movie
musical Victor/Victoria to the stage.

Julie worked as hard as ever on this show, and
it was a big success.

Over the years, Julie sometimes found that
her voice got very tired, especially after singing in
a Broadway show for many months in a row. She
had to take long rests, do special exercises, and
occasionally have surgery to help keep her voice
healthy. But at one point, something went wrong.

After her most recent surgery, she found that she
couldn’t sing at all.


Julie was sad—she loved to sing! But although
fifty years had passed since she had read alone
in her dressing room, she knew books could still
bring comfort in a difficult time. With the help
of her daughter Emma, Julie wrote and published

many more children’s books and books about her
own life.

Julie stayed busy. She helped others, spent
time with her family, and kept starring in films.
She played a queen in the Princess Diaries movies
and another queen in the Shrek movies. But she
said it was the greatest honor of her life when
the real queen—Queen Elizabeth II—gave her
a special award honoring her work.


Julie Andrews followed her dreams, going
from her small village to London, New York,
Hollywood, and all over the world. She worked
hard to create unforgettable characters on the
screen, in books, and onstage.

Her many fans will always be
inspired by her talents, and they
will always love Julie Andrews.

== Oprah Winfrey
When Oprah got a little older, she lived
with her mother and younger half siblings in
Milwaukee. They didn’t have much money, and
life there was hard.

One Christmas, some nuns came to her house
and gave her and her family food and toys. The
nuns made Oprah feel special. She decided she
would help others like that someday, too.

Oprah’s high grades helped her become one
of the first Black students to attend a school in
the wealthy part of town. But Oprah soon started
misbehaving. So in high school, Oprah went to
live with her father, Vernon, and her stepmother,
Zelma, in Nashville, Tennessee.


Life was different there. Vernon was strict and
made sure Oprah did well in school. She followed

her dad’s rules, worked hard, and made many
friends.

At seventeen, Oprah won the Miss Fire
Prevention beauty pageant. When she picked up
her prize at a Nashville radio station, a DJ heard
her speak. He knew her voice was special, and he
hired Oprah to read the news as an after-school

job. She loved reading out loud, and now she was
being paid to do it!

-
Oprah was an excellent news anchor, but she
didn’t hide her feelings. Sometimes when a story
was sad, she would cry. Her boss didn’t like that.

But a new boss realized Oprah’s emotions were
a good thing—she could connect with others. He
made her cohost of a talk show called People Are
Talking. Audiences loved Oprah!


Just a few years later, Oprah moved to Illinois
and became the host of her own talk show called
AM Chicago. Again, Oprah was a hit!

One fan was a producer named Quincy Jones.
He asked her to act in his movie The Color
Purple. As a child, Oprah had admired beautiful
Black performers like Sidney Poitier and Diahann
Carroll, so this was a dream! She played the
role of Sofia so well she was nominated for an
Academy Award.

In 1986, The Oprah Winfrey Show, as AM
Chicago was now called, was shown across
America! That same year, Oprah started Harpo
Productions (Harpo is Oprah spelled backward)

and became the first Black woman to own a
TV studio.

Oprah worked hard to make her show great.
She talked with regular people and famous
people. She had fun road trips and awesome rock
concerts. She also shared secrets about herself.
Her show was so popular because Oprah made
everybody feel special.

Oprah was famous, just as she had dreamed.
But not everyone was nice to her. Sometimes
people made up stories about her past or said
unkind things about how she looked.

Thankfully, Oprah has people she can trust,
including her best friend, Gayle, and her partner,
Stedman Graham.

Oprah’s fans trust her opinion on just about
everything. Oprah loves reading, so she started a
book club. Many of the books she recommends
become bestsellers because so many people want
to read what she’s reading.


Some fans even wanted her to run for
president! Oprah wasn’t interested in that job,
but she spoke highly of someone who was: a

rising politician named Barack Obama.

CHANGE

WE CAN BELIEVE IN

People listened. Obama was elected
president twice.

Oprah’s hard work has earned her a lot of

money, and her big heart has led her to share her

wealth in many ways. Once she gave an entire
audience brand-new cars!


In 2011, after twenty-five years and 4,561
episodes, Oprah ended her beloved talk show.
But she’s still as busy as ever. She continues to
interview celebrities, produce and star in movies,
oversee her media platform Oprah Daily, run

her television network (OWN), and support
numerous charities.

When she’s not working, Oprah enjoys
spending time with her family and friends at
her beautiful homes, taking long walks with her
“fur children” (she’s had more than twenty dogs
S throughout the years!), and curling up with
serenade

a good book.

Oprah never forgot how special she felt when
those nuns helped her family so many years ago.
Now she uses her gifts to help make millions of
other people feel special, too.

== Jonny Appleseed
a fine September day

more than two hundred

years ago, a boy named. John

J ohnny grew up in Massachusetts,
in a small, crowded house.

He liked to take long walks in the woods, where

it was calm and quiet. He liked to feel the sun on his
face and the earth under his bare feet.

When Johnny turned eighteen, he took a very long Settlers were starting to go west in covered

Johnny had an idea.

cider. But there were no apple trees out west. Even
if the settlers planted seeds, it would take years for
trees to sprout and grow fruit.

Why not give the
settlers a head start?

Johnny reached Pennsylvania. Near a river, he
found a patch of land with rich soil and plenty of
sunlight. A perfect place for growing apple trees!

He planted some seeds. Then he built a sturdy
fence so that when the new seedlings came up,
deer and rabbits wouldn’t eat them.


Johnny planted more seeds—thousands of them—

Meanwhile, the settlers came. Sure enough, they
across Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. He worked wanted apples! They were happy to pay Johnny a few
and he walked, going from nursery to nursery to tend
his trees.

cents apiece for seedlings. Sometimes he even gave
them away to families who were
down on their luck.



People spread the word about Johnny and his
apple trees. That’s how he got his nickname.

Have you met Johnny Appleseed? He’s mighty kind,
people said. Mighty peculiar, too!

It was true. For one thing, Johnny looked

strange. He wore old, ragged pants. He cut holes
in coffee sacks to make his shirts.

He still didn’t wear shoes. By now, folks

claimed, his feet were so tough, a snake’s fangs
couldn’t prick them!


... and then cook his dinner in it!

Johnny’s diet was
another thing people
couldn’t get over. He
didn’t like to hurt
animals, so he wouldn’t
eat meat. Not one bite!
He filled up on corn
mush, potatoes, and

- nuts instead.

a pile of leaves.
He didn’t seem to
worry about the bear:



Johnny might have been odd, but he was friendly.
He got along with just about everyone he met.

Native Americans shared their trails with him.
They showed him which berries were safe to eat,

and how to make medicine from leaves and roots.

Settlers invited Johnny into their cabins and asked

him to tell stories. Sometimes he read from the Bible.

“Good news fresh from heaven!” he’d say. Other times,
he acted out his own wild adventures.



People retold Johnny’s tales . . . and made up new
ones, too! As the years went by, the tales grew taller
and taller... .

Once he tricked ten
woodsmen into a chopping
contest. They cleared a
whole acre of land for

Did you know Johnny can thaw ice
with his bare feet?

He has a tame wolf that
follows him around like

a puppy!



The stories wound their way east and west
and back again.

So did Johnny. He traveled hundreds of miles
a year, making new nurseries and tending the ©
old ones.

He kept this up for nearly fifty years!


Johnny was sorely missed. But he was not forgotten—
and neither was his great idea.
As settlers moved farther and farther west, they

carried along apple seeds, just the way Johnny had.
They planted apple trees of their own.

Today, apples grow in every state in America!

The apples that grew on Johnny’s trees
were mostly “‘spitters.” That meant they were

too sour to eat! Settlers used them to make
cider and vinegar.

Johnny’s worn-out clothes made him look
poor, but he wasn’t. When he died, he owned
over a thousand acres of land.

There’s a monument for Johnny in
Indiana, near the spot where he died. The
stone lists both of his names: JOHN CHAPMAN

and JOHNNY APPLESEED. And underneath:
HE LIVED FOR OTHERS.

Johnny probably walked more than a
hundred thousand miles in his lifetime.
