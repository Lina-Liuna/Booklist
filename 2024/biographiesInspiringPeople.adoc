Julie Andrews was born on October 1, 1935, in a village called - Walton-on-Thames , — in England.

She grew up ina talented family. When she
_ was a little girl, her aunt would help put on show:

at a nearby playhouse. Julie’s mother would play —

piano, and her father built sets.

Julie gave her very first performance at one
of these shows. And she helped a fellow dancer
whose hat had fallen over her eyes. Even at age _
three, Julie knew the show must go on! F


When Julie was four years old, World War ge

began. At that point, Julie was living with her

mother and stepfather in London, where bombs
often fell.

To stay safe, Julie and her brother sometimes
had to go to the countryside and live with
strangers. While there, they loved learning
to ride horses.

Other times, her family hid in the London
Underground train stations with their neighbors.
Her stepfather would play guitar to take people’s

_ minds off the danger.


Meanwhile, Julie was learning to dance and sing.
She went to a special school, where she learned
ballet and tap dance. At age nine, she started taking
singing lessons.

Julie’s mother was a wonderful piano player, and her stepfather was a well-known
singer. They started to invite Julie onstage to sing with them.Julie enjoyed the
spotlight.

Not long after the war finally ended, Julie was
asked to perform for some British soldiers. She
didn’t know that Queen Elizabeth would also be

in the audience! The queen told Julie that she sang
beautifully.


Julie became known for her sweet, high
voice. She spent her teenage years traveling
around England, singing and dancing in
shows. She loved the stage, but she missed
her family when she was away.

Whenever she was homesick, Julie would
go to her dressing room and read. Books
helped her feel less lonely.



When Julie was sixteen years old, she went to
see a musical on the West End of London, where
some of the best plays in the world are performed.

Julie was amazed. The music! The costumes!
The sets! She never thought she would have the
chance to be in a show like that.

But she would—and soon! Just two years
later, Julie was cast as the star in Cinderella on
the West End. There were fancy costumes, a big
moving set, and real ponies on the stage. Julie
and the show got great reviews.

Thanks to the success of Cinderella,
Julie got her next big break—a role in a
Broadway musical, called The Boy Friend. ~~
Julie was going to New York!




Julie was sad to leave, but she couldn’t say no
to Broadway. Her whole family gathered at the
airport to see her off.

While rehearsing in New York, Julie struggled
at first. Sometimes she felt she was doing a good
job, and other times she didn’t. The director told
her to play the role as honestly as she could. On
opening night, the audience gave the show a
standing ovation.


The cast and crew waited overnight at a
nearby restaurant to read the reviews in the
next morning’s newspaper. The critics loved
the show—and Julie. It was official. Julie
Andrews was a Broadway star!


Later that year, a songwriting
duo named Lerner and Loewe were
finishing their newest musical. They

didn’t think Julie would be available
to star in it because most Broadway §

actors had two-year contracts. But
Julie had only wanted a one-year |
contract for her first show so that 7
she could visit her family sooner.

After a quick trip to England, Julie went back
to New York to star in My Fair Lady.

Julie played a flower seller named Eliza
Doolittle who learns to speak like a fancy lady.
Just like Eliza, Julie had to learn to speak in a new
accent. It was very difficult.

Her hard work paid off. My Fair Lady became
the longest-running Broadway musical at the

time, and the cast recording was the number-one
album of 1956.


Julie continued to act and sing in hit
musicals. One day, Walt Disney visited her
backstage after a show. He wanted her to star
in his next movie. Julie had performed on
Broadway, at the famous Carnegie Hall,
and on television—but never in movies.

By then, Julie had gotten married. Not long after
giving birth to her first daughter, Julie and her family
flew to Hollywood, California, so Julie could star in
Walt Disney’s Mary Poppins. Julie won the Academy
Award for Best Actress for her performance as the
magical nanny—and fans everywhere learned the
word “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.”



In 1965, just one year after Mary Poppins was
released, Julie starred in The Sound of Music. In this
movie musical, Julie played a nun in training named
Maria who falls in love while looking after seven
children in the Austrian mountains. It became one
of her most famous roles, thanks to such songs as
“My Favorite Things” and “Do-Re-Mi.”

Julie spent the next twenty years starring in
movies. She also welcomed four more children
into her life.

One day, Julie’s stepdaughter, Jenny, asked her
to write a story for her. That was when Julie came
up with the idea for her first children’s book. She
would go on to write and publish many more.


Thirty-five years after leaving New York to
make Mary Poppins, Julie finally decided to return
to Broadway. She brought her role from the movie
musical Victor/Victoria to the stage.

Julie worked as hard as ever on this show, and
it was a big success.

Over the years, Julie sometimes found that
her voice got very tired, especially after singing in
a Broadway show for many months in a row. She
had to take long rests, do special exercises, and
occasionally have surgery to help keep her voice
healthy. But at one point, something went wrong.

After her most recent surgery, she found that she
couldn’t sing at all.


Julie was sad—she loved to sing! But although
fifty years had passed since she had read alone
in her dressing room, she knew books could still
bring comfort in a difficult time. With the help
of her daughter Emma, Julie wrote and published

many more children’s books and books about her
own life.

Julie stayed busy. She helped others, spent
time with her family, and kept starring in films.
She played a queen in the Princess Diaries movies
and another queen in the Shrek movies. But she
said it was the greatest honor of her life when
the real queen—Queen Elizabeth II—gave her
a special award honoring her work.


Julie Andrews followed her dreams, going
from her small village to London, New York,
Hollywood, and all over the world. She worked
hard to create unforgettable characters on the
screen, in books, and onstage.

Her many fans will always be
inspired by her talents, and they
will always love Julie Andrews.
