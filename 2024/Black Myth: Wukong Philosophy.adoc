Recently, several of my friends have been posting a lot about the game Black Myth: Wukong. I’m not usually into role-playing games, but I’m a huge fan of Wukong. He’s one of the main characters in the book Journey to the West, which has been my favorite book since I was seven. The book is filled with incredible stories. Out of curiosity, I watched my friend play Black Myth: Wukong for a while, and I noticed it’s quite different from the original tale.

In the game, the player takes on the role of a monkey known as the "Destined One," whose main mission is to restore the power of the legendary Sun Wukong by collecting six relics: Craving Eyes, Fuming Ears, Hubris Nose, Envious Tongue, Grieved Body, and Freed Mind.

My friends told me there are currently two endings. In the first, the Destined One gathers the six relics, battles the Stone Monkey, and emerges victorious. As a reward, the old monkey places the Tightening Band on the Destined One’s head. This ending is often seen as the first play through or loop, symbolizing a never-ending cycle where a new Destined One eventually rises to defeat the current one and become the next Sun Wukong.

In the preferred ending, the Destined One gathers not only the six relics but also the Five Skandhas: form, feeling, thought, choice, and consciousness. After defeating Yang Jian and the Four Heavenly Kings, Yang Jian, having overcome his inner demons, bestows his weapon upon the Destined One. The Destined One then battles the Stone Monkey again but refuses the Tightening Band. As the new Monkey King of Flower Fruit Mountain, they lead a rebellion of demon kings against the Heavenly Court.

I find this ending more compelling because of its seamless blend of Chinese Taoist and Buddhist philosophies. The six relics represent the six desires that bind humans both mentally and physically. Only through cultivation and self-improvement can one break free from these chains and achieve true freedom and happiness.

In the game, the Destined One acquires the 'thought' relic from Erlang Shen, symbolizing detachment and enlightenment. By combining this with the other relics and the Five Skandhas, the player transforms into a Spiritual Enlightenment Stone Monkey, reviving Sun Wukong and ushering in a new era of peace. The Destined One may even take on a new role in this world.
One of the fascinating aspects of Black Myth: Wukong is its six-chapter structure, each ending with a short story. In Chapter 2, we're treated to the tale of the Scholar and the Fox.

The story follows a scholar who encounters a wounded white fox in the mountains. After rescuing the fox, the scholar dreams of a loving relationship and family. However, this dream turns into a nightmare when the fox devours their children.

Waking up, the scholar tragically kills the fox, skins it, and continues their journey. The scholar's belief in their own righteousness and control could be seen as a manifestation of hubris. Their desire for a perfect family life and envy of the fox's freedom might connect to the Envious Tongue relic. The Scholar's physical and emotional suffering could be related to the Grieved Body relic, representing the pain and sorrow of worldly existence.

Lingji Bodhisattva declared, 'All creatures have their own nature, and we cannot disrupt the natural order based on notions of superiority and inferiority.

The game is filled with amazing stories based on the classic tale of The Journey to the West, which is my favorite fairy tale.
