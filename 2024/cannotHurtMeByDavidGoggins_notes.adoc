CHALLENGE #1

My bad cards arrived early and stuck around a while,
but everyone gets challenged in life at some point. What
is your bad hand? What kind of crap are you dealing
with? Are you getting beaten? Abused? Bullied? Do you
ever feel insecure? Maybe your limiting factor is that
you are growing up so supported and comfortable, you
never push yourself?

What are the current factors limiting your growth and
success? Is someone standing in your way at work or
school? Are you underappreciated and overlooked for
opportunities? What are the long odds you’re up against
right now? Are you standing in your own way?

Break out your journal—if you don’t have one, buy one,
or start one on your laptop, tablet, or in the notes app on
your smart phone—and write them all out in minute de-
tail. Don’t be bland with this assignment. I showed you
every piece of my dirty laundry. If you were hurt or are
still in harm’s way, tell the story in full. Give your pain
shape. Absorb its power, because you are about to flip
that pain on its head.

You will use your story, this list of excuses, these very
good reasons why you shouldn’t amount to anything, to
fuel your ultimate success. Sounds fun right? Yeah, it
won’t be. But don’t worry about that yet. We’ll get
there. For now, just take inventory.

Once you have your list, share it with whoever you
want. For some, it may mean logging onto social media,
posting a picture, and writing out a few lines about how
your own past or present circumstances challenge you
to the depth of your soul. If that’s you, use the hashtags
#badhand #canthurtme. Otherwise, acknowledge and
accept it privately. Whatever works for you. I know it’s
hard, but this act alone will begin to empower you to
overcome.

CHALLENGE #2

It’s time to come eyeball to eyeball with yourself, and
get raw and real. This is not a self-love tactic. You can’t
fluff it. Don’t massage your ego. This is about abolish-
ing the ego and taking the first step toward becoming
the real you!

I tacked Post-It notes on my Accountability Mirror, and
I’ll ask you to do the same. Digital devices won’t work.
Write all your insecurities, dreams, and goals on Post-
Its and tag up your mirror. If you need more education,
remind yourself that you need to start working your butt
off because you aren’t smart enough! Period, point

@ AQ

blank. If you look in the mirror and see someone who is
obviously overweight, that means you’re fat! Own it!
It’s okay to be unkind with yourself in these moments
because we need thicker skin to improve in life.

Whether it’s a career goal (quit my job, start a
business), a lifestyle goal (lose weight, get more active),
or an athletic one (run my first 5K, 10K, or marathon),
you need to be truthful with yourself about where you
are and the necessary steps it will take to achieve those
goals, day by day. Each step, each necessary point of
self-improvement, should be written as its own note.
That means you have to do some research and break it
all down. For example, if you are trying to lose forty
pounds, your first Post-It may be to lose two pounds in
the first week. Once that goal is achieved, remove the
note and post the next goal of two to five pounds until
your ultimate goal is realized.

Whatever your goal, you’ll need to hold yourself ac-
countable for the small steps it will take to get there.
Self-improvement takes dedication and self-discipline.
The dirty mirror you see every day is going to reveal the
truth. Stop ignoring it. Use it to your advantage. If you
feel it, post an image of yourself staring into your
tagged-up Accountability Mirror on social media with
the hashtags #canthurtme #accountabilitymirror.

CHALLENGE #3

The first step on the journey toward a calloused mind is
stepping outside your comfort zone on a regular basis.
Dig out your journal again and write down all the things
you don’t like to do or that make you uncomfortable.
Especially those things you know are good for you.

Now go do one of them, and do it again.

In the coming pages, I’ll be asking you to mirror what
you just read to some degree, but there is no need for
you to find your own impossible task and achieve it on
the fast track. This is not about changing your life in-
stantly, it’s about moving the needle bit by bit and mak-
ing those changes sustainable. That means digging
down to the micro level and doing something that sucks
every day. Even if it’s as simple as making your bed,
doing the dishes, ironing your clothes, or getting up be-
fore dawn and running two miles each day. Once that
becomes comfortable, take it to five, then ten miles. If
you already do all those things, find something you
aren’t doing. We all have areas in our lives we either ig-
nore or can improve upon. Find yours. We often choose
to focus on our strengths rather than our weaknesses.
Use this time to make your weaknesses your strengths.

Doing things—even small things—that make you un-
comfortable will help make you strong. The more often
you get uncomfortable the stronger you’ll become, and
soon you'll develop a more productive, can-do dialogue
with yourself in stressful situations.

Take a photo or video of yourself in the discomfort
zone, post it on social media describing what you’re do-
ing and why, and don’t forget to include the hashtags
#discomfortzone #pathofmostresistance #canthurtme
#impossibletask.

CHALLENGE #4

Choose any competitive situation that you’re in right
now. Who is your opponent? Is it your teacher or coach,
your boss, an unruly client? No matter how they’re

i


treating you there is one way to not only earn their re-
spect, but turn the tables. Excellence.

That may mean acing an exam, or crafting an ideal pro-
posal, or smashing a sales goal. Whatever it is, I want
you to work harder on that project or in that class than
you ever have before. Do everything exactly as they
ask, and whatever standard they set as an ideal outcome,
you should be aiming to surpass that.

If your coach doesn’t give you time in the games, domi-
nate practice. Check the best guy on your squad and
show out. That means putting time in off the field.
Watching film so you can study your opponent’s ten-
dencies, memorizing plays, and training in the gym.
You need to make that coach pay attention.

If it’s your teacher, then start doing work of high quali-
ty. Spend extra time on your assignments. Write papers
for her that she didn’t even assign! Come early to class.
Ask questions. Pay attention. Show her who you are and
want to be.

If it’s a boss, work around the clock. Get to work before
them. Leave after they go home. Make sure they see
what you’re doing, and when it’s time to deliver, sur-
pass their maximum expectations.

Whoever you’re dealing with, your goal is to make
them watch you achieve what they could never have
done themselves. You want them thinking how amazing
you are. Take their negativity and use it to dominate
their task with everything you’ve got. Take their soul!

Afterward, post about it on social and add the hashtag
#canthurtme #takingsouls.

CHALLENGE #5

It’s time to visualize! Again, the average person thinks
2,000-—3 000 thoughts per hour. Rather than focusing on
things you cannot change, imagine visualizing the
things you can. Choose any obstacle in your way, or set
a new goal, and visualize overcoming or achieving it.
Before I engage in any challenging activity, I start by
painting a picture of what my success looks and feels
like. I'll think about it every day and that feeling pro-
pels me forward when I’m training, competing, or tak-
ing on any task I choose.

But visualization isn’t simply about daydreaming of
some trophy ceremony —real or metaphorical. You must
also visualize the challenges that are likely to arise and
determine how you will attack those problems when
they do. That way you can be as prepared as possible on

the journey. When I show up for a foot race now, I drive
the entire course first, visualizing success but also po-
tential challenges, which helps me control my thought
process. You can’t prepare for everything but if you en-
gage in strategic visualization ahead of time, you’ll be
as prepared as you possibly can be.

That also means being prepared to answer the simple
questions. Why are you doing this? What is driving you
toward this achievement? Where does the darkness
you’re using as fuel come from? What has calloused
your mind? You’ll need to have those answers at your
fingertips when you hit a wall of pain and doubt. To
push through, you’ll need to channel your darkness,
feed off it, and lean on your calloused mind.

Remember, visualization will never compensate for
work undone. You cannot visualize lies. All the strate-
gies I employ to answer the simple questions and win
the mind game are only effective because I put in work.
It’s a lot more than mind over matter. It takes relentless
self-discipline to schedule suffering into your day, every
day, but if you do, you’ll find that at the other end of
that suffering is a whole other life just waiting for you.

This challenge doesn’t have to be physical, and victory
doesn’t always mean you came in first place. It can
mean you’ve finally overcome a lifelong fear or any
other obstacle that made you surrender in the past.
Whatever it is, tell the world your story about how you
created your #armoredmind and where it’s taken you.

CHALLENGE #7

The main objective here is to slowly start to remove the
governor from your brain.

First, a quick reminder of how this process works. In
1999, when I weighed 297 pounds, my first run was a
quarter mile. Fast forward to 2007, I ran 205 miles in
thirty-nine hours, nonstop. I didn’t get there overnight,
and I don’t expect you to either. Your job is to push past
your normal stopping point.

Whether you are running on a treadmill or doing a set of
push-ups, get to the point where you are so tired and in
pain that your mind is begging you to stop. Then push
just 5 to 10 percent further. If the most push-ups you
have ever done is one hundred in a workout, do 105 or
110. If you normally run thirty miles each week, run 10
percent more next week.

This gradual ramp-up will help prevent injury and allow
your body and mind to slowly adapt to your new work-
load. It also resets your baseline, which is important be-
cause you’re about to increase your workload another 5
to 10 percent the following week, and the week after
that.

There is so much pain and suffering involved in physi-
cal challenges that it’s the best training to take com-
mand of your inner dialogue, and the newfound mental
strength and confidence you gain by continuing to push
yourself physically will carry over to other aspects in
your life. You will realize that if you were underper-
forming in your physical challenges, there is a good
chance you are underperforming at school and work
too.

The bottom line is that life is one big mind game. The
only person you are playing against is yourself. Stick

with this process and soon what you thought was im-
possible will be something you do every day of your
life. I want to hear your stories. Post on social.

CHALLENGE #8

Schedule it in!

It’s time to compartmentalize your day. Too many of us
have become multitaskers, and that’s created a nation of
people who get lots of things halfway done. This will be
a three-week challenge. During week one, go about
your normal schedule, but take notes. When do you
work? Are you working nonstop or checking your
phone (the Moment app will tell you)? How long are
your meal breaks? When do you exercise, watch TV, or
chat to friends? How long is your commute? Are you
driving? I want you to get super detailed and document
it all with timestamps. This will be your baseline, and
you'll find plenty of fat to trim. Most people waste four
to five hours on a given day, and if you can learn to
identify and utilize it, you’ll be on your way toward in-
creased productivity.

In week two, build an optimal schedule. Lock every-
thing into place in fifteen- to thirty-minute blocks. Some
tasks will take multiple blocks or entire days. Fine.
When you work, only work on one thing at a time, think
about the task in front of you and pursue it relentlessly.
When it comes time for the next task on your schedule,
place that first one aside, and apply the same focus.

Make sure your meal breaks are adequate but not open-
ended, and schedule in exercise and rest too. But when
it’s time to rest, actually rest. No checking email or


wasting time on social media. If you are going to work
hard you must also rest your brain.

Make notes with timestamps in week two. You may still

find some residual dead space. By week three, you CHAPTER NINE

should have a working schedule that maximizes your

effort without sacrificing sleep.



CHALLENGE #9

This one’s for the unusual people in this world. A lot of
people think that once they reach a certain level of sta-
tus, respect, or success, that they’ve made it in life. I’m
here to tell you that you always have to find more.
Greatness is not something that if you meet it once it
stays with you forever. It evaporates like a flash of oil in
a hot pan.

If you truly want to become uncommon amongst the un-
common, it will require sustaining greatness for a long
period of time. It requires staying in constant pursuit
and putting out unending effort. This may sound appeal-
ing but will require everything you have to give and
then some. Believe me, this is not for everyone because
it will demand singular focus and may upset the balance
in your life.

That’s what it takes to become a true overachiever, and
if you are already surrounded by people who are at the
top of their game, what are you going to do differently
to stand out? It’s easy to stand out amongst everyday
people and be a big fish in a small pond. It is a much
more difficult task when you are a wolf surrounded by
wolves.

This means not only getting into Wharton Business
School, but being ranked #1 in your class. It means not
just graduating BUD/S, but becoming Enlisted Honor

Man in Army Ranger School then going out and finish-
ing Badwater.

Torch the complacency you feel gathering around you,
your coworkers, and teammates in that rare air.
Continue to put obstacles in front of yourself, because
that’s where you’ll find the friction that will help you
grow even stronger. Before you know it, you will stand
alone.



CHALLENGE #10

Think about your most recent and your most heart-
wrenching failures. Break out that journal one last time.
Log off the digital version and write them out long-
hand. I want you to feel this process because you are
about to file your own, belated After Action Reports.

First off, write out all the good things, everything that
went well, from your failures. Be detailed and generous
with yourself. A lot of good things will have happened.
It’s rarely all bad. Then note how you handled your fail-
ure. Did it affect your life and your relationships? How
so?

How did you think throughout the preparation for and
during the execution stage of your failure? You have to
know how you were thinking at each step because it’s
all about mindset, and that’s where most people fall
short.

Now go back through and make a list of things you can
fix. This isn’t time to be soft or generous. Be brutally
honest, write them all out. Study them. Then look at
your calendar and schedule another attempt as soon as
possible. If the failure happened in childhood, and you

can’t recreate the Little League all-star game you
choked in, I still want you to write that report because
you'll likely be able to use that information to achieve
any goal going forward.

As you prepare, keep that AAR handy, consult your
Accountability Mirror, and make all necessary adjust-
ments. When it comes time to execute, keep everything
we’ve learned about the power of a calloused mind, the
Cookie Jar, and The 40% Rule in the forefront of your
mind. Control your mindset. Dominate your thought
process. This life is all a mind game. Realize that. Own
it!

And if you fail again, so be it. Take the pain. Repeat
these steps and keep fighting. That’s what it’s all about.
