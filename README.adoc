5. Lina Liu personal ideas:
   How do we identify who am I?
   We are part of a global community, shaping our sense of identity not solely based on factors like gender, race, and class.
   As humans, we learn, imitate, and emulate behaviors from parents, teachers, and individuals worldwide to integrate into this global community.
   Just as no two leaves are identical in the world, even genetically identical twins may not be completely identical in all aspects, they may have distinct personalities and characters during the process of imitation.
   The more we imitate and learn from others, the more we discover our uniqueness compared to those around us. Our uniqueness becomes our authentic selves.


   Why some people have racial discrimination? or how racial discrimination formed?

   I believe it's a big and complex topic related to historical, social and cultural factors.
   I remembered I read a book it mentioned why we like people who live by the same code?
   The author gave several reasons: First, they are rendered mutually predictable to one another,
   Second, they believe they have shared belief and some culture system;
   Third, they know what to expect from everyone else.
   So I think the root of racial bias is people fear of unknown, they lake the experience/knowledge to people from different racial background,
   they may rely on stereotypes or assumptions to judge people in the wrong way.
