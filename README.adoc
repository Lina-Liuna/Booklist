5. Lina Liu personal ideas:
   1). How do we identify who am I?
   We are part of a global community, shaping our sense of identity not solely based on factors like gender, race, and class.
   As humans, we learn, imitate, and emulate behaviors from parents, teachers, and individuals worldwide to integrate into this global community.
   Just as no two leaves are identical in the world, even genetically identical twins may not be completely identical in all aspects, they may have distinct personalities and characters during the process of imitation.
   The more we imitate and learn from others, the more we discover our uniqueness compared to those around us. Our uniqueness becomes our authentic selves.

   2). Why do some people have racial discrimination? or how racial discrimination formed?

   I believe it's a big and complex topic related to historical, social, and cultural factors.
    I remember I read a book that mentioned why we like people who live by the same code.
    The author gave several reasons:
   First, they are rendered mutually predictable to one another,
   Second, they believe they have shared beliefs and some cultural system;
   Third, they know what to expect from everyone else.
   So I think the root of racial bias is people's fear of the unknown, they lack the experience/knowledge of people from different racial backgrounds,
   They may rely on stereotypes or assumptions to judge people in the wrong way.

3). To Asian immigrant parents: How to raise kids to prevent emotional damage?

For immigrant parents, the pursuit of quality education and a better life often propelled them to take education into their own hands, viewing learning centers as a means to bridge gaps within the educational system and effectively prepare their children for success. However, it is imperative to emphasize the necessity of avoiding excessive pressure and over-scheduling. We must consistently remember that each child is a unique individual entitled to the freedom to shape their own path. This involves nurturing and celebrating the distinctive individuality of every child while concurrently instilling values that champion diligence and a strong work ethic.
Asian mothers, and indeed all parents, are encouraged to prioritize emotional nurturing and the celebration of individuality. In a world marked by inequality and competition, it's crucial to empower children not only to excel academically but also to possess the resilience, self-sufficiency, and intrinsic motivation needed to pursue their passions.
Asian immigrant parents goal is to empower our children not only to excel in their pursuits but also to possess resilience in the face of adversity, self-sufficiency to navigate life's complexities, and the intrinsic motivation to pursue their passions.

4). Why short-form content software like TikTok is
so popular and why many people become addicted to scrolling through it.

   1. “‘Shortcuts’ provide harried readers with a quick ‘taste’ of the day's news, sparing them the  ‘less efficient’ method of actually turning pages and reading articles.“(Nicholas 4)
Have you ever addicted "short video content" such as 'how to finish reading 'Gone with the Wind' in 20 minutes' or 'master 3 skills to become a successful person.'? Actually, this type of video content lacks substance and is easily forgotten, it's  'filled with the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom' and fails to exercise one's memory.

   2. “The Internet is always on a quest to find the "one best method" or the perfect algorithm for
every mental task we describe as "knowledge work.’", the Internet customizes content to meet our preferences, which I believe is the primary reason why we become addicted to it.

   3. Compared to reading a book, which trains your brain to think deeply, scrolling through
screens to "learn what you want" is much easier and convenient. However, the truth is that it
can lead to “intellectual laziness” and “weaken your mind”.
