GOOD EVENING. IT WAS A
DIFFERENT SCENE THIS AFTERNOON,
AND CREWS CONTINUED TO MOP UP
THE SCENE AFTER SPENDING
SEVERAL HOURS IN THE SWELTERING
HEAT. IT TOOK FIREFIGHTERS AND
MULTIPLE AGENCIES TO FINALLY
GET AN UPPER HAND AND SOME HELP
FROM THE POWER COMPANY. A

PLUMES OF SMOKE FILLING THE AIR
, A THIRD HOME CAUGHT ON FIRE,
HEAVILY DAMAGED, AS WELL. FIRE

THE VERY FIRST HOUSE JUST
TOTALLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES.
Reporter: AROUND 24
DIFFERENT FIRE CREWS RESPONDED
TO THE STRUCTURE FIRE AND
FIRE OFFICIALS REQUESTED A
POWER SHUT OFF FOR SAFETY
PURPOSES WHILE BATTLING THE
FLAMES.
AND POWER LINES ARE VERY
CLOSE TO SUPPRESSION EFFORTS,
SOMETIMES THEY MAY BE DIRECTLY
INVOLVED OR WE MAY ASK THEM TO
BE TURNED OFF FOR THE SAFETY OF
FIREFIGHTERS.

BUSINESSES WERE WITHOUT POWER
DURING THE HOTTEST PART OF THE
DAY. LATER IN THE EVENING,
