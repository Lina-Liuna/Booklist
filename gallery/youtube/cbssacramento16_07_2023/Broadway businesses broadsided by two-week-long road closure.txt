THREE MONTHS
ANOTHER STREET CLOSURE IN SACRAMENTO HAS RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINE
SHE MET THE WEEKS
THE CONSTRUCTION IS HAPPENING AFTER A FOUR BLOCK STRETCH IN SACRAMENTO'S LANDMARK NEIGHBORHOOD
WE ARE GETTING REACTION TONIGHT FROM MERCHANTS IN THAT AREA
Reporter: BUSINESSES ALONG THE BROADWAY CORRIDOR ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT WILL TEAR UP THE ROADWAY
BEGINNING MONDAY, BOTH LANES OF EAST ON BROADWAY BETWEEN 16th AND 20th STREET WILL BE CLOSED UNTIL JULY 30th
A NEW UNDERGROUND PGE GAS MAKE CAN BE INSTALLED
SOME MERCHANTS THINK THE CONSTRUCTION WILL DRIVE AWAY CUSTOMERS
AS A SMALLER BUSINESS, WE ARE SO WORDING ON THE DRIVE-BY TRAFFIC IN THE TRAFFIC THAT WE ARE COMING FOR YOU
Reporter: THERE ARE NO PARKING LOTS AROUND THE STRETCH OF BROADWAY
MY CONCERNS FOR CUSTOMERS NOT BEING ABLE TO PARK IS THAT THEY MIGHT GO SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH PARKING
THAT'S NOT VERY Reporter: THEY RECEIVED NO NOTICE ABOUT THE CLOSURE
WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE CITY AT ALL
HOPING THAT CUSTOMERS WILL FIND A WAY TO COME BACK TO THE CLOSURE
IF YOU COULD WALK FROM WHATEVER AREA YOU CAN, COME
