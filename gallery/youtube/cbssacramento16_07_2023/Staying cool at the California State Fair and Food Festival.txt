HEAR THE WATERFALL
IT IS PRETTY CLOSE TO US
OUR CBS13 TEAM IS ALL OVER THE FAIRGROUNDS TODAY
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU AROUND THROUGHOUT THE HOUR
THE HEAT IS WELL ABOVE 100 DEGREES
MY CAR SAID 100 DEGREES AT 2:00 AS WE WERE DRIVING IN
SOME RIDES ARE CLOSED
Reporter: WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE
LIVE FROM COOLING CENTERS WITH HOW PEOPLE ARE BEATING THE HEAT
ASHLEY, MAKEUP NOT RECOMMENDED FOR A DAY LIKE TODAY
Reporter: DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR A DAY LIKE TODAY BECAUSE IT IS JUST MELTING OFF OF MY FACE AS WELL
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IT IS HOT OUT HERE
THAT IS NO SURPRISE
WE KNOW USUALLY AROUND FAIR TIME IT IS USUALLY HOT
BUT THEY ARE THANKFUL
FAIRGOERS THIS YEAR SAY THAT THEY ARE THESE
THERE'S FOUR OF THEM IN PLACE THIS YEAR
THEY SAY THE MISTERS ARE A BIG HELP TOO
KEEPING EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT COOLER
TO GIVE YOU GUYS SOME PERSPECTIVE, I BROUGHT OUT MY HANDY DANDY THERMOMETER GUN
IT PAVEMENT IS OUT HERE AND WE WILL TEST IT IN THERE AS WELL
WE ARE GOING TO GET A GOOD READING FOR YOU GUYS
I'M GETTING ABOUT 140 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
DEFINITELY VERY WARM
LET'S WALK INSIDE OF THE COOLING CENTER
THEY ARE ALREADY SETTING UP ANOTHER AIR CONDITIONING UNIT
CAN YOU BEAT IT? INSIDE HERE, THIS IS HOW COOL IT IS
DEFINITELY A BIG DIFFERENCE
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE 91 DEGREES
STILL DEFINITELY WARM
BUT THESE ARE A BIG HELP THIS YEAR
IT IS WARM, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP ME FROM GETTING OUT AND DOING THINGS I ENJOY DOING
Reporter: THE CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR IS BACK
AND SO IS THE HEAT
JULY
ALWAYS HOT
Reporter: FAIRGOERS PREPPED AND READY FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF SACRAMENTO'S TRIPLE DIGIT TEMPERATURES
111
112
113 EVERY DAY
Reporter: EACH HAVING THEIR WE KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE HOT LATER ON
SO WE GET HERE EARLY AND DO WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO AND GET OUT BEFORE IT IS TOO HOT
Reporter: ORGANIZERS ADDED MORE WAYS TO ENJOY THE FUN, BY CENTERS
MORE SHADED AREAS
WE ARE KEEPING OURSELVES COOL WITH THESE COOL FANS THEY GAVE US AT THE FRONT DESK
Reporter: AND MORE FUN FOR KIDS INDOORS
I'M GLAD IT IS INSIDE BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET REALLY HOT AND SWEATY
Reporter: THEIR ADVICE BEFORE YOU COME VISIT -- COME EARLY
HYDRATE A LOT
PLENTY OF DRINKS
WATER
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO COOL OFF WITH
FRESH SQUEEZED LEMONADE
I PLAN ON HITTING IT NEXT
Reporter: AND I THINK I SQUEEZED LEMONADE MYSELF
YES, THE COOLING PLACES ARE WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
COOLING CENTERS LIKE THIS ONE
THEY JUST TURNED ON THE FAN
IF YOU'RE AT THE FAIRGROUNDS, THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
ALSO, DON'T FORGET THAT WATER IS ALLOWED IF YOU ARE INSIDE THE GATES BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT L.I.D
IS TIGHTLY SEALED BECAUSE IF IT IS NOT, THEY WON'T LET YOU BRING IT IN
