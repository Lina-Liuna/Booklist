THERE
KEEPING TEMPERATURES RIGHT AROUND 70 DEGREES
WE WOULD LOVE THAT RIGHT ABOUT NOW
TIME TO GET A CHECK ON THE WEATHER, WITH FIRST ALERT WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT, A LITTLE BIT OF SHADE, A LITTLE BIT OF COOL WEATHER COMING IN
SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
OCEAN BREEZES RIGHT ABOUT NOW, BUT THAT NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
MOST OF US DEALING WITH DANGEROUS HEAT
HERE IS A LOOK AT TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW
RIGHT NOW, PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IS IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS
SITTING IN THE 90s, IN THE VALLEY
THE HEAT IS HERE AND WE ARE IN THE THICK OF IT
IF YOU DO HAVE ANY OUTDOOR PLANS, RIVER C.A.T
SCAN, HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID BEFORE
BRING LOTS OF WATER, BECAUSE WE KEEP THE TRIPLE DIGIT HEAT GOING JUST-IN-TIME FOR FIRST 8:00, WILL DROP INTO THE UPPER 90s, BUT A VERY WARM EVENING ON TAP ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE HEADING OUT TO THE RIVER C.A.T
SCAN
OVERALL, THE OVERNIGHT AND 70s
NOT MUCH RELIEF, ESPECIALLY FOR THE FOOTHILLS
BUT, HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT'S AHEAD FOR TOMORROW
WE WILL KEEP IT GOING
TEMPERATURES WARM UP AGAIN FAST, JUST IN TIME FOR SUNDAY MORNING
GETTING BACK INTO THE LOWER 70s BY 7:00 A.M., UPPER 70s BY AROUND 9:00, AND THROUGH THE AFTERNOON, BACK IN THE 90s AS EARLY AS 11 BEFORE THE TRIPLE DIGIT HEAT KICKS UP EVEN MORE
HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT TOMORROW AFTERNOON
MOST OF US BACK INTO TRIPLE DIGITS, WE WILL FLIRT NEAR 107, 108 THROUGH THE SOUND, BUT, THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GO, AWAY FROM THE DELTA BREEZES, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE EXPECTING MOSTLY TO BE CONCENTRATED
AS FOR THE FOOTHILLS, THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE VALLEY, MOST OF US IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS
IN THE SIERRA, 90s, BACK, AGAIN
AS FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY, EXPECT TRIPLE DIGIT HEAT
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TURLOCK, 108-109
LOTS PLANNING ESCAPING THE HEAT TOMORROW, DOES THAT, GO TO THE BAY AREA
TOMORROW WILL BE BACK IN THE 70s AROUND SAN FRANCISCO, EVEN INTO OAKLAND
BUT THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE VALLEY FLOOR, TRIPLE DIGIT HEAT ARRIVES ONCE AGAIN
BUT TOMORROW, WE WILL BREAK SOME RECORDS AS WELL
HERE'S A LOOK WHAT THE RECORDS ARE FOR EACH LOCATION
FOR SACRAMENTO, THE RECORD IS 108, AND THE FORECAST IS AT 107
FOR STOCKTON, WE ARE BEATING THE TOMORROW AT 110, MODESTO AT 108, TOMORROW
THAT RECORD IS 107
IN SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM THE AND THE RECORD IS AT 89
SO, HE IS HERE TO STAY, AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE FUTURECAST HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE START TO SHIFT EASTER MONDAY AND INTO TUESDAY, BRINGING US A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF, A LITTLE BIT MORE DELTA BREEZES, THEY WILL START TO FUNNEL IN
VICINITY OF THE WEST FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS
EVEN AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO NEXT WEEKEND NEXT WEEKEND
EXPECT THE HEAT TO STAY EVEN LONGER, EVEN THOUGH WE WILL GET A BRIEF BREAK MIDWEEK
HERE'S A LOOK AT HOW THAT LOOKS ON THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WE WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER 90s COME TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY, BUT BY THE TIME WE HAD THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND EVEN INTO NEXT WEEKEND, WE ARE BACK INTO THE TRIPLE DIGITS AGAIN
AS FOR THE BAY AREA, BREAK ON A TUESDAY, AND INTO WEDNESDAY
AND WE MAY EVEN SEE A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY AS WELL ACROSS THE SIERRA
OVERALL, THE HEAT IS THERE TO STAY ACROSS THE REGION
HAPPENING TONIGHT, ANOTHER
