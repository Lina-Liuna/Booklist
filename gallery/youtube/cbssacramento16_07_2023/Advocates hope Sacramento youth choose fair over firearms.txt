WHERE THEY ARE HEADED TRYING TO BEAT THE HEAT
BUT FIRST, THE STATE FAIR KICKS OFF A NIGHT OF FUN WITHOUT FEAR
TRYING TO KEEP KIDS SAFE DURING A SURGE IN VIOLENCE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
I AM TONY LOPEZ
AND I AM AMANDA GAITHER
THE CHANGES LAST YEAR, THAT COULD KEEP THINGS SAFE THIS Reporter: WHEN YOU THINK STATE FAIR, YOU THINK LIGHTS
LAST YEAR
NOBODY UNDER 18 CAN GET IN WITHOUT AN ADULT
THINGS CLOSING AROUND 10:00 WHICH MEANS LOCAL ADVOCATES SAY THIS IS THE PLACE THEY WANT YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY TO BE
THE STATE FAIR HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A MARVELOUS PLACE FOR OUR YOUTH
AND Reporter: THE STATE FAIR, IF YOU ASK DARRELL ROBERTS, IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUTH TO SEE THEIR FUTURES
COMPONENT OF THE FAIR
NOT JUST KIDS WHO COME FROM PRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES, BUT THE SECTIONS OF TOWN THAT ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE
THIS CENTER THAT THERE IS A NAME MORE THAN TWO DECADES AGO
HE CALLED THE FAIR A POSITIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENT, EXPOSURES AND A CHANCE FOR LIFE BEYOND WHERE THEY LIVE 
THAT CAN BE A NEGATIVE SPACE IF IT'S NOT PROPERLY MONITORED, NOT BY POLICE
BUT BY A COMMUNITY AND ADULTS
PARENTS SHOULD COME TO THE STATE FAIR WITH THEIR KIDS
Reporter: THE STATE FAIR ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY SLOW THE RECENT SURGE OF YOUTH GUN VIOLENCE , NOT ENDED
INVEST MORE OF YOUR SELF WORK
EVEN IF IT IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, WE CANNOT JUST LEAVE THE KIDS OUT THERE
Reporter: WHILE SOME WILL TAKE THE FAIR OVER FIREARMS, THERE ARE STILL YOUTH WHO NEED INTERVENTION
IT'S WHY MOVEMENT FOR LIFE SHOWS UP TO THEM
DO MORE PULLING UP WHERE THEY KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE
BOXES WITH LITTLE CAESARS OR A COUPLE OF CASES OF WATER AND SOME CAPRI SONS OR WHATEVER
THE KIDS ARE THERE
Reporter: YOU HAVE THE FIREWORKS AND THE KIDS ARE THERE TONIGHT
AGAIN, THE FAIR HAS ENDED AT 10:00 AND YOU SEE THE WAVE OF YOUNG PEOPLE THEIR FAMILIES
I REACHED OUT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY SAY THEY SUPPORT ANY KIND OF YOUTH ENGAGEMENT EVENT ESPECIALLY OVER THE SUMMER, WHEN MANY ARE OUT OF SCHOOL AND WITH FREE TIME ON THEIR HANDS, COMES OPPORTUNITIES TO FILL IN THE BLANKS LIKE WITH ACTIVITIES OF THE FAIR
