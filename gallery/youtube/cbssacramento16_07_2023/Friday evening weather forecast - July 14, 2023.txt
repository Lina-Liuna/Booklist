RENOVATIONS WILL BEGIN LATE
FALL OR EARLY WINTER OF THIS
YEAR AND IT IS EXPECTED TO BE
COMPLETE BY MEMORIAL DAY OF
2024. THEY HAVE GOT SOME TIME
TO WAIT.
AND HAVING DINNER OR DRINKS AND
THINKING, WHERE CAN WE GO?
DEFINITELY THE STATE FAIR IS
GOING TO BE HOT. TAHOE IS NOT
REALLY A ESCAPE, RIGHT?
90 IS EVEN FOR SOUTH LAKE
TAHOE, JUST AMAZING TO SEE THE
ONE UP THERE. BUT IF YOU'RE
HEADING OUT TO ONE UP KURTIS
AND WIN ANOTHER EMOJI THIS
EVENING, 8:00, TEMPERATURES
START TO COOL OFF A LITTLE BIT.
NOT MUCH, VERY SLOW TO COOL OFF
TONIGHT FOR THE STATE FAIR.
HOTTER, THOUGH. TOMORROW, 110.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A NEW
RECORD IF WE MANAGED TO REACH
110 TOMORROW. ELK GROVE AT 108
DEGREES, LOTS OF SUNSHINE.
EVEN DOWN INTO FAIRFIELD, WE
WILL BE SEEING HIGHS INTO THE
ONE OF THE WARMER SPOTS,
MARYSVILLE AT 111 DEGREES. YOU
CAN SEE THE HEAT IN PLACE FOR
MUCH OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
THE AIR MASS WILL BE VERY DRY
THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW, AND
NOT MUCH WIND AT ALL, LESS THAN
FIVE MILES PER HOUR. COLFAX,
102. THE FOOTHILLS, I THINK
ONE OF THE GREATEST IMPACT. IT
IS NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO
BE HOTTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. AT
NIGHT, YOU WILL BE. THAT'S
WHY, YOU DON'T GET AS MUCH
RELIEF DURING THE OVERNIGHT
HOURS, WHICH IS WHY THE HEAT
POSES MORE OF A RISK FOR THOSE
SENSITIVE TO THE HEAT UP THERE
IN THE FOOTHILLS. 100 DEGREES
TUOLOMNE COUNTY, YOU CAN SEE
THE TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE
100 FROM ARNOLD DOWN TO THE
LOWER ELEVATIONS. THEY ARE
VALLEY AT 90 DEGREES FOR A
HIGH. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN
VALLEY, 108 FOR STOCKTON AND
MODESTO. SO, A LOT OF HEAT IS
WITH US, NOT JUST FOR TRIAL,
BUT SUNDAY VERY SIMILAR WHEN IT
COMES TO THE HIGH TEMPERATURES.
BRIEFLY STARTS TO DRIFT TO THE
EAST. WHAT THAT MEANS FOR US?
IT MEANS OUR TEMPERATURES WILL
START TO GO DOWN INTO THE 90s.
IT IS GOING TO FEEL NICE. WE
HAVE A SLIGHT BREEZE ALSO OFF
THE DELTA TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY, YOU WILL NOTICE THAT
WITH THIS PATTERN, BUT LATER
THE SAME WEEK, THE RIDGE BUILDS
RESULT IN A RETURN TO TRIPLE
DIGIT HEAT. HERE IS YOUR
FORECAST FOR THE WEEK AHEAD.
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, FIRST
ALERT ACTION DAYS JUST BECAUSE
OF HOW HOT IT IS. I WILL BE
DOWN SUNDAY A BIT MORE. 109 FOR
SACRAMENTO. BUT SOME OF THE
WARMER SPOTS NORTH OF THE
SACRAMENT OF VALLEY WILL GET
INTO THE 100 TIMES. 104
MONDAY, STILL HOT. THEN SEE
THE DIP IN THE TEMPERATURES, WE
ARE BACK NEAR 100 FOR THE END
OF THIS WEEK. FOR THE
FOOTHILLS, TEMPERATURES STAYING
WEEKEND. YOU WILL BE COOLING
DOWN QUITE A BIT BY WEDNESDAY.
FOR THE SIERRA, CAN'T ROLL OUT
AN ISOLATED DRIVE THUNDERSTORM
