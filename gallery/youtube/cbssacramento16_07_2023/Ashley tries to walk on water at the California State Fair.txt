100s
TIMING IS EVERYTHING
TODAY WE GOT TO STAY INSIDE THE STUDIO
NICE AND COOL IN IT IS FEELING PRETTY GOOD
BUT WE DO HAVE TO ADMIT EVERYONE OUT AT THE STATE FAIR IS STILL HAVING A LOT OF FUN
INCLUDING CBS13'S KURTIS MING AND ASHLEY WILLIAMS
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY ARE UP TO
Reporter: THIS IS CALLED THOUGHT ASHLEY COULD WALK ON WATER
NOW WE ARE GOING TO SEE IT FOR SURE
WE WANT HER TO RUN LIKE A HAMSTER IN THERE
WE WILL SEE IF SHE FALLS OR NOT
OH
DO A LITTLE PLAY-BY-PLAY
IS THIS NORMAL? IS THIS WHAT WE EXPECT? ABSOLUTELY
IT IS REALLY CANNOT GET ANY TRACTION
BUT ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, YOU CAN ACTUALLY RUN UP AND DOWN THIS POOL NO PROBLEM
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO RUN UP AND DOWN THE POOL
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN DO THAT
ALL RIGHT
WE GAVE HER INSTRUCTIONS
STRAIGHT AND KIND OF RUN IN PLACE
THE NATURAL REACTION IS TO TRY TO GET YOUR BALANCE BUT EITHER WAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT TIME
Reporter: HOW LONG DO YOU ALLOW THEM TO BE IN THEIR? AIR IN THERE
THEY GET A LITTLE WARM BECAUSE THEY ARE ACROSS THEM ANYMORE
SHE WILL BE PLENTY TIRED AFTER THIS
I THINK SHE IS READY TO GET OUT
ARE YOU READY TO COME OUT? OKAY, SHE IS GETTING HOT
BY THE WAY, I WAS THE ONE
