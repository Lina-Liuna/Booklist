WHO HAS GOT MORE ON THE HEAT IF Reporter: THANKS, ASHLEY
WE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE CLOSED BECAUSE OF THE HEAT, BUT NOT SO MUCH THE THINGS THAT ARE OPEN IN SPITE OF THE HEAT
AND IT HELPS WHEN YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING LIKE THE BUMPER CARS THAT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SHADE TO THEM
THIS ONE HAS BEEN OPEN ALL MORNING AND ALL AFTERNOON, IT HAS BEEN EXCITING FOR A LOT OF FOLKS
THIS IS THE SAME SET OF BUMPER CARS THAT WERE AT MICHAEL JACKSON'S NEVERLAND RANCH
A LITTLE INTERESTING STORY ABOUT THE RIGHT INSPECTOR, ALAN, WHO ACTUALLY TOOK A LOOK AT AND IMPROVED ALL OF THE RIDES WAS THE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS
HE WAS ACTUALLY THE LEAD INSPECTOR AT NEVERLAND RANCH, WORKED WITH MICHAEL FOR 15 YEARS AND CLOSELY
HIS KIDS BABYSAT MICHAEL'S KIDS WHEN HE WAS SHEPHERDING ALL OF THESE RIDES AT THE FAIR, MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE FOR EVERYONE, INCLUDING THIS ONE WITH A LOT OF HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE BEHIND IT
NOW, HERE AT THE FAIR, A COUPLE OF RIDES ARE CLOSED
THE ONES WITH SLIDES AND FIBERGLASS ESPECIALLY , WITH ALL THE SUN HITTING THEM, THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE COME BY NOW
BUT IF YOU DO COME AROUND AND YOU DO SEE SHADED RIDES LIKE THIS, AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER RIDES THAT HAVE METAL AROUND THEM , AND INTO THE WATER, THOSE ARE OPEN
STILL HOT, BUT PLENTY OF THINGS TO KEEP YOU COOL
