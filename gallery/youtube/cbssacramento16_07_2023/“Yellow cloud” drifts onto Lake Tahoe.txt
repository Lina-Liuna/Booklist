90s. WE WILL HAVE MORE IN THE
FORECAST INCLUDING THE HEAT
WAVE IN 10 MINUTES.
IF YOU GO TO THE TAHOE
AREA, BEWARE OF THE POLLEN!
IT'S DURING THE SHORELINE
YELLOW.
CBS 13'S BRADY HOWARD IS ON
THE NORTH SHORE TAKING A DEEP
DIVE INTO WHAT'S CAUSING IT.
Reporter: PEOPLE ARE CALLING
FROM THE SUGAR PINE TREES AND
LANDS IN THE LAKE ON THE
SHORELINES. MANY VOTERS THINK
IT'S AN EYESORE. IT'S ALSO NOT
ALL THAT BAD, SAY SCIENTISTS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT LIKE
THIS.
Reporter: ALL IT TAKES IS A
LIGHT BREEZE TO STRIP OFF THE
POLLEN FROM THE SUGAR PINE
TREES AND HAVE IT LANDS ON
EVERYTHING DID
EVERYTHING IS TINTED YELLOW
THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
Reporter: HER CAR, ROOF, AND
CHECK OUT THIS UMBRELLA ON HER
ITS WAY TO THE WAKE.
WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE LAKE SO MUCH, AND
THIS YEAR YOU CAN.
THE SOUTH, POLLEN IS
EVERYWHERE, AND IT'S MUCH
DENSER THIS YEAR THAN IT'S BEEN
IN DECADES.
NATURE IS DOING ITS OWN
THING REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE
WANT.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH CENTER.
THEY SAY THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN
IS THE RESULT OF A PERFECT
STORM . FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS
OF DROUGHT OR CAUSING THE SUGAR
PINE TREES TO PRODUCE
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POLLEN.
PEOPLE HAVE LIVED HERE FOR
DECADES AND DECADES, THEY HAVE
NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
Reporter: IT MAY CAUSE
LAKE STAYS A.
TO IMPACT THE CLARITY, THEY
WOULD HAVE TO BE A LOT SMALLER
THAN THEY ARE. THE GOOD NEWS
IS, IT'S NOT DOING ANY HARM ,
IT'S JUST NATURE DOING WHAT HE
WANTS TO DO.
Reporter: HOW LONG WILL IT
TO THE END OF POLLEN SEASON,
SO IT WILL EVENTUALLY SINK TO
THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE. BUT IT
COULD TAKE A FEW WEEKS.
WHAT A SIGHT. THANK YOU.
