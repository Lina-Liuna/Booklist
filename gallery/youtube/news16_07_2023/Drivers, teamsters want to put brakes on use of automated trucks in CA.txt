TRUCK DRIVERS AND TEAMSTERS
RALLIED ON THE STREETS OF CITY
HALL THIS MORNING.
MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
THE SAFETY OF SELF-DRIVING
CAR'S.
THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE AND
FIRE DEPARTMENTS HAVE CRITICIZED
THE CARS FOR BLOCKING EMERGENCY
CREWS.
DEMONSTRATORS TODAY SAY THEY ARE
ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE
POSSIBILITY OF DRIVERLESS TRUCKS
AND BIG RIGS COMING TO THE
GOLDEN STATE.
>> THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVE
DRIVEN RIGHT INTO A FIRE SCENE.
WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THOSE
ISSUES AND GET THEM UNDER
CONTROL SO THERE IS NO WAY WE
SHOULD EVEN BE HAVING A
DISCUSSION ABOUT TRUCKS OR
LARGER VEHICLES.
REPORTER: AFTER THE RALLY,
DEMONSTRATORS MARCHED TO A
PUBLIC DMV WORKSHOP REGARDING
THE TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT OF
SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES.
>> WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF
ITEMS TODAY.
MAINLY ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE A
SAFETY DRIVER AND THE VEHICLE.
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS
THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY
FOR A SAFETY DRIVER?
REPORTER: SELF-DRIVING BIG RIGS
ARE BEING TESTED IN STATES LIKE
TEXAS AND ARIZONA BUT NOT IN
CALIFORNIA.
RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA STATE
ASSEMBLY PASSED A BILL, ASSEMBLY
BILL 316, REQUIRING AUTONOMOUS
BIG RIGS, SEMI TRUCKS AND
VEHICLES OVER 10,000 POUNDS TO
HAVE A TRAINED HUMAN OPERATOR IN
THE VEHICLE.
VETERAN TRUCK DRIVERS
DRIVING FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES
SUPPORT THE BILL.
>> MY CONCERN IS AI WON'T BE
ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE THINGS
THAT A HUMAN CAN.
I'VE GOT YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.
I KNOW TO LOOK DOWN THE ROAD A
MILE TO SEE POTENTIAL HAZARDS.
80,000 POUNDS DRIVING HEADLONG
UNMANNED TERRIFIES ME.
REPORTER: THE VEHICLE INDUSTRY
ASSOCIATION ARGUES THAT
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES CAN DRIVE
MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN PEOPLE.
AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES COULD
CURB DANGEROUS DRIVING.
>> WE HAVE THESE LOSSES
BECAUSE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR.
WE HAVE THINGS LIKE DRUNK
DRIVING AND IMPAIRED DRIVING,
DISTRACTED DRIVING AND DROWSY
DRIVING.
AUTONOMO
