STRETCH OF SANTA TERESA
BOULEVARD EVERY DAY, BUT WHAT
ONE MAN SAW MADE HIM STOP IN HIS
TRACKS.
THIS YOUNG MOUNTAIN LION WAS
FOUND DEAD.
>> LEFT A LAY THERE WASN'T A LOT
OF TRAFFIC.
HE REMOVED THE LION FROM THE
ROADWAY, SHOWED RESPECT FOR THIS
CREATURE AND THEN CALLED US.
>> THEY COULD NOT DO A NECROPSY
BECAUSE THE BODY WAS GONE BY THE
TIME THEY WENT TO COLLECT IT.
THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE SANTA
CLARA OPEN-SPACE AUTHORITY SAY
THEY FEEL SHORT WAS HIT I-8 CAR
-- HIT BY A CAR.
>> THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY FAST
ROADWAY, CARS ARE TRAVELING
SOMETIMES 55 MILES PER HOUR.
AND CERTAINLY AT NIGHT WHEN
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC.
THAT IS WHEN ANIMALS ARE OUT.
>> NORTH COYOTE VALLEY WAS
PROTECTED.
THOUSANDS OF ACRES FOR WILDLIFE.
BUT MAJOR ROADWAYS ARE STILL
PART OF THE LANDSCAPE LIKE
HIGHWAY 101, MONTEREY HIGHWAY,
AND SANTA TERESA BOULEVARD.
MCKENZIE SAYS WILDLIFE'S OF
CULVERTS UNDER 101 TO CROSS.
>> WE ARE CONSERVING THESE
LANDSCAPES.
WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO
SAFELY GET WILDLIFE ACROSS THIS
LANDSCAPE.
>> THAT INCLUDES WILDLIFE
CROSSING PROJECTS.
>> WE ARE HOPING TO HAVE
WILDLIFE UNDER CROSSINGS AND
BRIDGES IN COYOTE VALLEY.
THERE IS ONE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
ON 152 AND IN 101 IN SAN BENITO
COUNTY.
>> THE UNFORTUNATE DEATH OF THIS
YOUNG MOUNTAIN LION
