DAN: TONIGHT ONE MAN'S WAY OF
TRYING TO BUILD A BETTER BAY
AREA ALTHOUGH NOT ONE POLICE
WOULD RECOMMEND.
LAST YEAR IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE
WERE 20,000 REPORTED THEFTS FROM
VEHICLES.
WE SPOKE WITH A SAN FRANCISCO
RESIDENT AND BUSINESS OWNER WHO
HAS TAKEN IT ON HIMSELF TO FIGHT
BACK AND PROTECT HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> THE SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT
YOU ARE ABOUT TO MEET SAYS HE IS
HOPING TO HELP HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
AT FIRST HE WAS YELLING AT
THIEVES BREAKING INTO CARS.
NOW HE IS WALKING AROUND THE
AREA HOPING TO SCARE THEM OFF.
HE HAS LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO
OVER 20 YEARS AND INSTEAD OF
GOING BY HIS LEGAL NAME.
>> I'M CALLED BOOTS, WORKING
FROM OUTSIDE RATHER THAN INSIDE.
>> COVERING RATHER -- HIS FACE
TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY, HE
WALKS AROUND FISHERMAN'S WHARF
AND WITH A NONLETHAL WEAPON ON
HIS WASTE THAT LOOKS LIKE A GUN.
HIS GOAL IS TO SCARE OFF THIEVES
FROM BREAKING INTO CARS.
>> THE CRIMINALS ARE GETTING TO
KNOW US.
IT IS JUST CONCERNED CITIZENS.
EVERY DAY IS A SMALL VICTORY.
YOU CHASE THEM OFF FROM ONE
CORNER.
>> FOR YEARS HE HAS CAPTURED
VIDEOS OF CAR BREAK-INS AND
FRUSTRATIONS LED HIM TO TAKE
MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS.
HE SAYS HE IS DOING IT TO HELP
THE AREA WHERE HE LIVES AND OWNS
A BUSINESS.
>> THE TOURISTS ARE NOT GOING TO
COME HERE.
THE BUSINESS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
LIVED HERE IN BEEN HERE THEIR
ENTIRE LIVES.
IT IS NOT FAIR.
>> ACCORDING TO SFPD, THERE ARE
67 THEFTS FROM VEHICLES EVERY
DAY IN SAN FRANCISCO.
OUTSIDE OF THIS BRUNCH SPOT,
AUTHORITIES SEE BREAK-INS ON A
DAILY BASIS.
>> THEY GRAB YOUR STUFF AND THEY
ARE GONE.
>> MANY WHO WORK HERE SHARE A
COMMON SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS.
>> YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
>> SFPD ARRESTED BOOTS FOR
BRANDISHING AN IMITATION FIREARM
WHICH IS A MISDEMEANOR.
>> WE DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE
DOING THAT.
WE UNDERSTAND EVERYONE'S
FRUSTRATION.
OFFICERS ARE FRUSTRATED IN
TAKING THE NUMBER OF POLICE
REPORTS REGARDING AUTO
BURGLARIES.
HOWEVER, THERE IS A SYSTEM IN
PLACE TO DO THAT.
>> SFPD SAYS THEY ARE SHORT
STAFF.
BOOTS VIEWED THIS AS ANOTHER
VICTORY.
>> WHILE THE POLICE WERE THERE
THERE WAS NO ONE GETTING THEIR
CAR BROKEN INTO FOR THAT
HALF-HOUR.
>> THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW IF
WHAT HE IS DOING IS WORKING, BUT
WE MET THIS COUPLE FROM NEW YORK
WHO DID THE UNTHINKABLE.
>> I SEE YOUR SUITCASES IN THE
BACK
