THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS THE INFAMOUS OTTER BUT HERE SHE IS
REPORTER: U.S
FISH AND WILDLIFE SAYS THIS OTTER HAS APPROACHED SURFERS AND KAYAKERS
THIS PHOTOGRAPHER HAS CAPTURED HER
>> I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN ORDER COME THIS CLOSE TO SHORE OR GET CLOSE TO SURFERS
THEY AVOID SURFERS
REPORTER: OFFICIALS SAY WHILE THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF INJURY, THE OTTER IS A SAFETY RISK
A TEAM FROM THE U.S
FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AND MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM MONITORED HER AND ATTEMPTED TO CAPTURE HER
>> A SURFER IS GOING TO GET HURT, OR SHE WILL BITE SOMEONE
IF SHE BITES SOMEONE, I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN

I KNEW I HAD NO CHANCE AGAINST HER IF SHE STARTED ATTACKING ME
